## How to organize data by using folders in github (Personal preference only)

- Create the sub-directory (folder) by making a new file in github. This will become your new subfolder

- Keep adding new file until desired subfolders are created.
- To add a file on a particular folder/subfolder, perform the same procedure above [Click new file].
- This time add the corresponding file extension. (e.g. .R, .MD)
- On the RStudio, execute a push command to update and copy changes into your RStudio project.
- Work on your code and execute commit/push to update github files.
